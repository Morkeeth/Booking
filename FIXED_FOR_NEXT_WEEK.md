# ✅ FIXED - Automatic Booking for Next Thursday

## I'm Sorry - Here's What Was Wrong:

### ❌ Problem 1: Schedule was DAILY instead of THURSDAYS
**Before:** `cron: '0 6 * * *'` - Ran EVERY day  
**Now:** `cron: '0 6 * * 4'` - Runs ONLY on **Thursdays** ✅

### ❌ Problem 2: Old date (Oct 29)
**Before:** `"date": "29/10/2025"` - Last week's date  
**Now:** `"date": "5/11/2025"` - Next Wednesday ✅

---

## ✅ FIXED AND PUSHED TO GITHUB

**Next automatic run:**
- **Date**: Thursday, October 30, 2025
- **Time**: 8:00 AM CEST (automatic)
- **Will book for**: Wednesday, November 5, 2025 at 8 PM
- **Location**: Édouard Pailleron (priority)

## ⚠️ ONE MORE THING - Verify Workflow is Enabled

The workflow page should be open in your browser.

**Check:**
1. Look at the workflow status
2. If you see "This workflow is disabled" → Click **"Enable workflow"**
3. You should see it's scheduled to run

**If it's already enabled** → You're all set! ✅

## What Happens Next Thursday (Oct 30):

**8:00 AM CEST:**
- GitHub Actions automatically runs ✅
- Logs into tennis.paris.fr
- Books court for **Wednesday, Nov 5 at 8 PM**
- Priority: **Édouard Pailleron**
- You receive confirmation email from tennis.paris.fr

**Your computer can be OFF** ✅

## For Future Weeks:

This will continue running **every Thursday at 8 AM** automatically.

To update for future weeks, you just need to change the date in the workflow:
- Nov 5 → Nov 12 → Nov 19 → etc.

Or I can help you set it to automatically calculate "6 days from now" if you want.

## Summary:

✅ **Fixed**: Now runs THURSDAYS only (not daily)  
✅ **Updated**: Date set to Nov 5, 2025  
✅ **Pushed**: Changes live on GitHub  
⚠️ **Action**: Verify workflow is enabled (in browser)

**I apologize for the confusion earlier. It's properly set up now for automatic booking next Thursday!**
