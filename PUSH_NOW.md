## üìç To Manually Trigger Tomorrow Morning

Go to: **https://github.com/Morkeeth/Booking/actions**

1. Click "Book Tennis Court"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Click green "Run workflow" button

## üîç Monitor the Run

After it runs, check: **https://github.com/Morkeeth/Booking/actions**

You'll see the workflow run with logs showing success or any errors.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The workflow is set to run **every day at 8 AM CEST** automatically
- It will book for **October 22nd specifically** (because date is set in config.json)
- After October 22nd, remove the `date` field if you want it to book 6 days in advance automatically
- Your credentials are secure - `config.json` is NOT in Git (check with `git status`)
